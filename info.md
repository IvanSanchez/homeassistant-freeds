Support for [FreeDS](https://freeds.es/) power surplus managers.

This integration allows users to read power and PWM values, and control the on/off and manual/auto state of PWM.

It has been tested with a FreeDS running 1.0.7 firmware. **There is no support for the 1.1.0 beta firmware**, yet.

See [https://freeds.es/](https://freeds.es/) for more information about the devices themselves, and see [https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/homeassistant-freeds](https://gitlab.com/IvanSanchez/homeassistant-freeds) for more information about this integration.
